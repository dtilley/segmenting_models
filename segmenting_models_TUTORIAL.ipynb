    "*The data and analysis included here was part of a project where I evaluated predictions of cardiomyocyte action potential models. One of my objective here is to review different clustering stratagies. The model features have biophysical and physiological meaning, but I will put a principal component step in as well. The data set here was the resulting output from training multiple populations of models using evolutionary optimization algorithms. I hope you find it interesting.*"
